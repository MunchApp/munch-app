To set up Google API key:

1. Create directory secrets under app (make sure you do not add it to git, do it outside of Android Studio to be sure)
2. Make a file called secrets.xml
3. Put the code on Slack channel inside the file
4. Run your code (verify that secrets is in your .gitignore and you are not tracking it before you commit any changes)
